```bash
bin/console mak:user

 The name of the security user class (e.g. User) [User]:
 > 

 Do you want to store user data in the database (via Doctrine)? (yes/no) [yes]:
 > 

 Enter a property name that will be the unique "display" name for the user (e.g. email, username, uuid) [email]:
 > 

 Will this app need to hash/check user passwords? Choose No if passwords are not needed or will be checked/hashed by some other system (e.g. a single sign-on server).

 Does this app need to hash/check user passwords? (yes/no) [yes]:
 > 

 created: src/Entity/User.php
 created: src/Repository/UserRepository.php
 updated: src/Entity/User.php
 updated: config/packages/security.yaml

           
  Success! 
           

 Next Steps:
   - Review your new App\Entity\User class.
   - Use make:entity to add more fields to your User entity and then run make:migration.
   - Create a way to authenticate! See https://symfony.com/doc/current/security.html
```

```bash
bin/console make:auth

 What style of authentication do you want? [Empty authenticator]:
  [0] Empty authenticator
  [1] Login form authenticator
 > 1

 The class name of the authenticator to create (e.g. AppCustomAuthenticator):
 > Oflix

 Choose a name for the controller class (e.g. SecurityController) [SecurityController]:
 > 

 Do you want to generate a '/logout' URL? (yes/no) [yes]:
 > 

 created: src/Security/OflixAuthenticator.php
 updated: config/packages/security.yaml
 created: src/Controller/SecurityController.php
 created: templates/security/login.html.twig

           
  Success! 
           

 Next:
 - Customize your new authenticator.
 - Finish the redirect "TODO" in the App\Security\OflixAuthenticator::onAuthenticationSuccess() method.
 - Review & adapt the login template: templates/security/login.html.twig.

Symfony Password Hash Utility
=============================

 Type in your password to be hashed:

 --------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------- 
  Key             Value

 --------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------- 

 ! [NOTE] Self-salting hasher used: the hasher generated its own built-in salt.                                         

                                                                                                                        
 [OK] Password hashing succeeded
